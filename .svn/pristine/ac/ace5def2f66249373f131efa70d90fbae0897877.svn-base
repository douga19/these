the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the
deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'.

./markovianSampler.tex:24: Undefined control sequence.
l.24  \Renvoie
              {$x_0$}
The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.

./markovianSampler.tex:24: Missing } inserted.
<inserted text> 
                }
l.24  \Renvoie{$
                x_0$}
I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.

./markovianSampler.tex:24: Missing $ inserted.
<inserted text> 
                $
l.24  \Renvoie{$x_
                  0$}
I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.
