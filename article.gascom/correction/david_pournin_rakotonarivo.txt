A Markov chain for lattice polytopes by Julien David, Lionel Pournin and Rado Rakotonarivo



In this paper, the authors present a Markov chain to generate random d-dimensional polytopes whose vertices' coordinates 
are integers ranging from 0 to k. There's been a raising interest on this kind of polytopes lately, in an attempt to 
understand how the size of the coordinates affects their combinatorial complexity. In particular, there are some 
intriguing open conjectures concerning them. Having available random instances is a good way to either disprove them or 
to have more evidence for their validity.


They present two variants of the Markov chain. In the first, a point is sampled randomly and added to the polytope if 
this operation increases the number of vertices, or removed it if it was a vertex. The main difficulty in this approach 
lies in proving that one can always add a vertex to the simplex case. Although the statement seems easy, the proof is 
rather involved and presented in an appendix. A second version treats the simplex case separately, thus easing the 
analysis. They show that the Markov chains are irreducible, aperiodic and symmetric, and hence converge to the uniform 
distribution. 

They present a crude estimate that shows that the mixing time grows at least like k^{d(d-1)/(d+1)}. I also 
suspect that the probability of looping will be very large, so it is not clear that this method will yield results for 
large values of k and d in practice. Yet, the approach is interesting and worth being explored, and fits perfectly the 
topic of the conference. I thus recommend accepting the paper.
